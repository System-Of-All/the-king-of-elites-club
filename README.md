## Public Legislative Context: Havana Act

Public advocacy surrounding neurological health incidents commonly referred to as “Havana Syndrome” contributed to increased international attention and institutional review.

In response to anomalous health incidents affecting U.S. personnel, the United States enacted the **Havana Act of 2021**, establishing financial support mechanisms for affected government employees.

This legislative milestone reflects broader recognition of neurological risk exposure and the need for structured institutional responses.

The King Of Elites Club incorporates themes of:

- Awareness
- Institutional accountability
- Human protection in technological environments
- Systemic resilience

The NFT collection does not claim authorship of legislation, operational intelligence authority, or government affiliation. It symbolically reflects the broader societal movement toward acknowledgment and structured response.

- Strategic clarity
